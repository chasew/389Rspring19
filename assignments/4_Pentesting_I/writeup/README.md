## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

Flag I found was CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}, inside of the file flag.txt.

Knowing the program was vulnerable to to command injection I knew it would probably be easy to execute my own command by simply using a semicolon between a valid or safe command and a malicious command. So with the command "google.com ; bin/bash" i was able to get access to the interactive shell and cd into the home directory which is where I found the flag.txt file.

My suggestion to v0idcache would be to either avoid using user input as code but if she cant to atleast sanitize the command arguments to avoid unwanted commends to be executed.

### Part 2 (60 pts)
