Who should you tell, if anybody?

I should definitely tell my boss and any higher ups who have assigned this task to me. I do not want to share this information with anybody who may cause harm with this information such as my bestfriend, the public, any dogs and even others who work for the company. If the bosses are unwilling to make necessary changes to the software all I can do is try to get them to change their mind since it is ultimately their decision. If I do nothing all of the harm that results as a consequence of this is on me. If I am aware that innocent people may be effected by something I have knowledge of and I did not try to do anything about it it is my fault since I could have done something to stop it to begin with.
